# rs-bridge ![Docker Pulls](https://img.shields.io/docker/pulls/catcoderr/rs-bridge) ![GitHub License](https://img.shields.io/github/license/swapcoffee/rs-bridge)

A simple, fast, and secure server-sent events bridge
for [TonConnect](https://docs.ton.org/develop/dapps/ton-connect/protocol/bridge) v2 protocol built with Rust.

Brought to you by [swap.coffee](https://swap.coffee) ☕️ ❤️

⚠️ **Note:** SSE bridge is maintained by the wallet provider. App developers do not have to choose or build a bridge.
Each wallet’s bridge is listed in the [wallets-list](https://github.com/ton-blockchain/wallets-list) config.

## Features

- [x] Fully implements the [TonConnect](https://docs.ton.org/develop/dapps/ton-connect/protocol/bridge) SSE bridge
  protocol specification.
- [x] Written in Rust with speed and safety in mind.
- [x] Optimized for low memory usage and high performance.
- [x] Can handle thousands of concurrent connections
- [x] Supports webhooks for wallet notifications.
- [x] Production-ready and battle-tested on [DeWallet](https://t.me/dewallet) with **1.8M** monthly active users.

## How to run

There is a pre-built Docker image available on [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/r/catcoderr/rs-bridge). You can
easily run it with the following command:

```bash
docker run -d --name rs-bridge -e RUST_LOG=info -p 8080:8080 catcoderr/rs-bridge:latest
```

⚠️ **Note:** If you provide authentication token for webhooks, it will be sent as a `Bearer` token in the
`Authorization` header meaning there is not need to prefix it with `Bearer`.

# Metrics

The server exposes Prometheus metrics on the `/metrics` endpoint running on the port specified by the `SSE_METRICS_PORT`
environment variable.

Here is the list of available metrics:

| Metric Name                                | Description                                    | Metric Type   |
